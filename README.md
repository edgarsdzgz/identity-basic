# Welcome to identity-basic

This is a basic web application that integrates: 
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node
- Express
- MySQL

HTML, CSS, and JS form the front-end. With vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation allowing for the whole of the front-end to work. It creates a simplified front-end which is able to make fetch calls to hit back-end routes similar to a React project. The back end runs on Node and Express. The routing is basic and calls upon a database service which queries MySQL. It is integrated with a MySQL database and uses standard SQL queries to populate and affect the DB. 
The basics of the application is to manipulate objects using a basic router and database. This is the basis for other projects, as I will be slowly building into other technologies that I am more excited about, such as:
 - React
 - RTK Query
 - Typescript
 - TypeORM

This application is not hosted, and was used with VS Code's Live server extension. The file index.html in the client folder can be run in that way and the application runs as intended.
The back-end is run with Node and `nodemon` can be used to execute app.js
