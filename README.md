# Welcome to identity-basic

This is a basic web application that integrates vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS with a Node and Express backend. It is integrated with a MySQL database and uses standard SQL queries to populate and affect the DB. 
The basics of the appliation is to manipulate objects using a basic router and database. This is the basis for other projects, as I will be slowly building into other technologies that I am more excited about, such as:
 - React
 - RTK Query
 - Typescript
 - TypeORM

This application is not hosted, and was used with VS Code's Live server extension. The file index.html in the client folder can be run in that way and the application runs as intended.
The back-end is run with Node and `nodemon` can be used to execute app.js
